To compile:
Open two seperate terminal.
In one terminal type: gcc -o server tcp_server.c
in the other, type: gcc -o client tcp_client.c

Now, in one terminal type: ./server 1234
In the other, type: ./client localhost 1234

NOTE: In case you are getting an error that the port is already in use,
try a different number (ex: 1222)

In the client window, you will be prompt to enter a message,
enter something and it should be shown on the server terminal
